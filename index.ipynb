    "The class size paradox describes apparent contradictory findings where a total allocation of resources is fixed. \n",
    "The idea behind this paradox is that there is a difference in how events are actually distributed and how events are perceived to be distributed. These types of divergence can have important consequences for data analysis. PMFs can help resolve some of these situations as you'll learn below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and explain the class size paradox \n",
    "* Use PMFs to visualize actual and biased observations\n",
    "* Calculate mean from PMFs to identify the expected value\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "At a university, the expected student-to-teacher ratio is 32.5 : 1. But randomly interviewed students often feel that their average class size is bigger than 32.5. There are two main reasons for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students typically take 4 - 5 classes at any given time, but teachers usually only teach 1 or 2 classes.\n",
    "2. The number of students in a small class is small, and the number of students in a large class is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the second fact, while randomly taking feedback from students (and sampling randomly), it is expected we will come across _more_ students from larger classes simply because there are more of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work through a set of data to recreate and analyze this paradox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a college offers 74 classes in a term. We can start with the following distribution of sizes and counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class size |  Class count |\n",
    "|--------|------|\n",
    "|15-19|\t10|\n",
    "|20-24|\t10|\n",
    "|25-29|\t18|\n",
    "|30-34|\t6|\n",
    "|35-39|\t8|\n",
    "|40-44|\t10|\n",
    "|45-49|\t5|\n",
    "|50-54|\t3|\n",
    "|55-59| 4|\n",
    "\n",
    "If the campus manager were asked about the average class size, he would perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Construct a PMF from given data\n",
    "2. Compute the mean using the PMF\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's follow the management approach first and see what expected value we get from our PMF. Here is a `size_and_count` dictionary to get you started. Calculate the PMF from this data as we have done before. To make it slightly more straightforward, we have averaged the class sizes for each class, i.e. for size \"15 - 19\", we use the average value, 17."

    "In this lesson, we looked at a common paradox called the \"class size paradox\", which deals with differences in observation by different people based on their circumstances. \n",

This paradox can become really complicated due to the large number of individuals involved and the resulting variations in the probabilities of their observations which arise due to their settings. "
